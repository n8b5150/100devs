Dear Hiring Manager,

Please find my resume attached for consideration for the Radiology Equipment Specialist position at OSU Wexner Medical center. I am eagerly seeking a position with growth potential that will utilize my specific skillset in a way that will enhance your organization.

I am currently employed as a Biomed Team Leader at the University of Toledo Medical Center. Over the past 5 years my responsibilities include imaging and radiation therapy, including surgical c-arms, nuclear medicine, interventional Xray, and PET/CT, and linear accelerators. 

I am experienced with all manner of repair of OEC 9900 C-arms including tube and high voltage cable replacement. This has led to a reduction in contract coverage and a substantial cost savings to the institution. 

I am responsible for planned maintenance and first look for our Philips IXR suites, GE SPECT, and Philips PET/CT. This not only saves UTMC in contract costs, but also downtime as vendor intervention is rarely necessary.

The most significant cost savings I am involved with are our Varian linear accelerators. I am responsible for planned maintenance and first look, which saves UTMC about $100,000 a year.

Over time, I have become the go to person in the shop when other technicians are stumped or do not have experience with various equipment. One of my strengths is learning quickly and retaining useful knowledge that applies to my career. This led to my current position as Biomed Team Leader. I have always enjoyed sharing my knowledge and experience with others, and enjoy when others share the same with me.

I hope to speak to you soon about my future at OSU. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to schedule an interview.

Sincerely,

Nathan Burks
