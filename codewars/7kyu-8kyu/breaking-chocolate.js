// Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

// For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

// If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer.

function breakChocolate(n,m){
    if ( n < 1 || m < 1) return 0
    else return n * m - 1
}

console.log(breakChocolate(2,1))
console.log(breakChocolate(3,1))
console.log(breakChocolate(2,2))
console.log(breakChocolate(3,3))
console.log(breakChocolate(5,5))
console.log(breakChocolate(1,1))
console.log(breakChocolate(0,-1))
console.log(breakChocolate(0,0))
