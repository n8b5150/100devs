1. Crafting Your Story
    Why am I here? Why am I the best person for this job and why did I apply?

    No matter what I do, I expand my knowledge of the subject to the edges so that I form an understanding from all points of view. I studied art, art history, all forms of painting, photography and all of it's processes. I started an electronics repair business and built guitar amplifiers and effects, servicing all types of gear, never turning down a repair that was difficult. I finished my education for electronics and started in Biomed, working on every level of technology from IV pumps to Linear Accelerators. Now I am a software engineer, seeking to do the same. I develop emersive websites with intuitive interactivity. My latest project is improving the experience of technicians using our computerized maintenance management system so that good information is entered in an efficient way.
