encapsulation: related methods and properties stored in an object

abstraction: simplify interface, hide complexity, make code reusable, write code once, able to use code without knowing or understanding it's underlying details, "simple, predictable, manageable"

inheritance: create new objects based on existing objects

polymorphism: code automagically works with many objects without the need for conditionals or switch cases
