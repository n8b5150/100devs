[Client.FirstName],
Thanks for reaching out to South End Web Design regarding your upcoming
development project. We specialize in HTML 5 app and website design and
development, and are excited to work with you to accomplish your goals. I've
prepared this document as a more thorough introduction to South End Web Design as
well as a detailed breakdown of the deliverables and pricing for your upcoming
project.

About South End Web Design
South End Web Design is a development firm specializing in HTML 5 apps and websites.
Our development team designs, builds, and supports websites for private and
public institutions around the world. We apply a well-tested framework to each
project that allows us to complete web development and application projects on
time and on budget without sacrificing features or functionality.

Our Approach
South End Web Design applies a six step framework to every development project. This
allows us to break projects down into distinct phases so that we can monitor
progression and results along the way.

1. Planning
Every project begins in the planning phase. In this phase, we work with the
customer to discover what your needs, wants, and true objectives are. This allows
us to thoroughly plan a complete project up front, avoiding costly delays and
unforeseen challenges later on.

2. Design
In this phase, we create mockups and prototypes based on earlier discussions. By
allowing you to review a visual representation of our understanding of your needs
early on in the project, we can further solidify your requirements and discover any
additional needs or challenges that did not present themselves in the planning
phase.

3. Build
In this phase, we begin the process of building your app or website. We place a
heavy emphasis on adhering to the technical and design specifications laid out in
the planning phase, and perform regular functional tests, which allows us to correct
any problems during the build rather than addressing them after project
completion.

4. Test & Train
We perform thorough testing on all sites and apps prior to final launch. We simulate
heavy stress to measure performance, and test various browsers, operating
systems, and devices with the site or app to be sure that it is responsive and
performs well across all platforms. We also perform training with your staff, so that
they will be able to easily make minor adjustments or publish new content once
your site or app is live.

5. Launch
The live launch of your site or app can be a stressful period. Even with thorough
testing throughout development, unforeseen challenges can arise. That's why the
South End Web Design team provides full monitoring and support during the launch
period. We stand ready to make sure that your launch is successful, and are ready
to quickly address any issues that arise.

6. Support
Once your site launches successfully, you'll still require a technical partner to
support ongoing needs. We offer a wide variety of support services for our
completed projects, including monitoring and optimization.
